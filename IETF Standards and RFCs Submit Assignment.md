## Working group 1: Internet Video Codec (netvc)
Area: Art

This WG is chartered to produce a high-quality video codec that meets the following conditions:

1. Is competitive (in the sense of having comparable or better performance) with current video codecs in widespread use.
2. Is optimized for use in interactive web applications.
3. Is viewed as having IPR licensing terms that allow it to be widely implemented and deployed.

To elaborate, this video codec will need to be commercially interesting to implement by being competitive with the video codecs in widespread use at the time it is finalized.

This video codec will need to be optimized for the real-world conditions of the public, best-effort Internet. It should include, but may not be limited to, the ability to support fast and flexible congestion control and rate adaptation, the ability to quickly join broadcast streams and the ability to be optimized for captures of content typically shared in interactive communications.

The objective is to produce a video codec that can be implemented, distributed, and deployed by open source and closed source software as well as implemented in specialized hardware.

The working group shall heed the preference stated in BCP 79: "In general, IETF working groups prefer technologies with no known IPR claims or, for technologies with claims against them, an offer of royalty-free licensing." In keeping with this BCP, the WG will prefer algorithms or tools where there are verifiable reasons to believe they are available on an royalty-free (RF) basis. In developing the codec specification, the WG may consider information concerning old prior art or the results of research indicating royalty-free availability of particular techniques. Note that the preference stated in BCP 79 cannot guarantee that the working group will produce an IPR unencumbered codec.

## Working group 2: Meeting Venue (mtgvenue)
Area: General

The selection of meeting venues for our physical meetings is a common
area of discussion at the IETF and feedback for the IAOC and its
meeting committee.

A specification of the venue selection process and criteria would be
useful. With community discussion and agreement such a specification
will be very helpful in improving the process and ensuring that the
relevant criteria are properly identified.

## Working group 3: DDoS Open Threat Signaling (dots)
Area: Security

The aim of DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is to develop a standards
based approach for the realtime signaling of DDoS related telemetry and
threat handling requests and data between elements concerned with DDoS
attack detection, classification, traceback, and mitigation.

The elements may be described as:
* On-premise DDoS mitigation platforms
* Service provider DDoS mitigation platforms
* Other network elements and services with the ability to analyze and/or
influence network traffic

Hi Pete,

Thanks for your answers and for addressing my concerns.

Here are a few answers to your returned questions:

what about 'where a substantial number of rooms are allocated for the IETF
meeting participants at negotiated rates'?

I am still unsure about the vagueness of 'burden'. Based on your
explanation, it may be appropriate to change: s/cost, time and burden/cost,
time and formalities/?

let us just say  "economic, health, and safety risks"  than.
